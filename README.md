# LedMatrix-Arduino (Bluetooth communication)

The main purpose of this project is to create an 10x10 rgb led matrix that is controlled by an android app after establishing bluetooth communication.

Here you can find the code for the the Arduino.

### Functional Requirements
- [x] connect/disconnect bluetooth device
- [x] change the color of each cell (led) individually
- [x] delete the entire matrix (shortcut to turn off the leds)
